# Light bulb Problem

    This program is used to visually simulate how a row of n number of light bulbs will change after the following
    algorithm occurs:
        - There are an n number of light bulbs in a row. All of them are off.
        - First pass (starting with the first bulb, pulls every switch) (Now every bulb is On)
        - Second pass (starting with the second bulb, pulls every second switch)
        - Third pass (starting with the third bulb, pulls every third switch)
        - This pattern continues until the number of passes would exceed the number of bulbs
        - What is the status of the bulbs at any given pass?
        - 1 is On
        - 0 is Off
